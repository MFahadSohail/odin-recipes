    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Basmati rice</li>
        <li>Meat (chicken, mutton, beef, fish, or shrimp) or vegetables (such as potatoes, carrots, peas)
                Aromatic spices (cumin, coriander, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom)</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li> Ginger</li>
        <li> Yogurt</li>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
            <li> Saffron or turmeric (for coloring and flavor)</li>
            <li> Ghee (clarified butter) or oil</li>
            <li> Fresh herbs (mint leaves, cilantro, or coriander leaves)</li>
            <li>Lemon juice</li>
            <li> Fried onions (birista)</li>
            <li> Milk (for soaking saffron)</li>
            <li> Water or broth</li>
            <li> Salt</li>
            <li>Optional spices and flavorings (nutmeg, mace, bay leaves, rose water, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse and soak the basmati rice in water for 30 minutes. Drain the water and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a separate pan or pot, heat ghee or oil and sauté sliced onions until golden brown. 
            Remove a portion of the fried onions for garnishing.</li>
        <li>Add ginger, garlic, and green chilies to the pan and sauté for a minute until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the meat (or vegetables) to the pan and cook until browned on all sides. If using meat, 
            it may require longer cooking time to become tender.</li>
        <li> Add spices such as cumin, coriander, turmeric, cinnamon, cloves, and cardamom to the pan. 
            Mix well to coat the meat (or vegetables) evenly.</li>
        <li> Stir in yogurt and tomatoes. Cook for a few minutes until the tomatoes soften and 
            the flavors blend together.</li>
        <li>Add water or broth to the pan, along with salt. Bring the mixture to a boil.</li>
        <li> Once the liquid is boiling, add the soaked and drained rice to the pot. Gently stir 
            to combine the rice with the meat (or vegetables) and spices.</li>
        <li> Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid, and allow the biryani to cook 
            for about 15-20 minutes, or until the rice is fully cooked and tender. 
            Avoid stirring the biryani during this process to prevent the rice from becoming mushy.</li>
        <li> In a separate small bowl, soak saffron strands in warm milk. After 10 minutes, drizzle the saffron-infused 
            milk over the top layer of rice. This will give the biryani a vibrant color and aroma.</li>
        <li>Garnish the biryani with fried onions and fresh herbs like mint leaves and cilantro.</li>
        <li> Cover the pot again and let it rest for a few minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
        <li> Before serving, gently fluff the rice with a fork, being careful not to break the grains. Serve the biryani 
            hot with raita (yogurt dip), salad, or any desired accompaniments.</li>
    </ol>
